SUBMITTED FILES:
	- README				| README file.
	- input.s 				| input file for SmallC Compiler.
	- makefile				| makefile.
	- smallc.l				| The lexical analyzer using flex.
	- smallc.y				| The syntax analyzer using Yacc.
	- semanticAnalysis.h	| Check the semantic error of source code.
	- quadruple.h			| Define some functions to create three-address code.
	- intermediateCode.h	| Define some functions to translate the source to intermediate code.
	- optimization.h		| Do some optimizations to eliminate the dead code and operations 
							  for register allocation.
	- codeGeneration.h		| Translate intermediate code to MIPS code.
	- include
		- header.h			| Include some necessary files and the definition of quadruple.
		- treeNode.h 		| The definition of abstract syntax tree.
		- symbolTable.h 	| The definition of symbol table.
	- 5140309178-report		| Report for SmallC Compiler.

EXECUTION:
	1. Enter the folder and using the shell command 'make'.
	2. Then you will get a executable file 'scc'.
	   - scc
	   		- ./scc inputFileName outputFileName
	     		The compiler will read in inputFileName. MIPS codes are written to outputFileName.
	   		- ./scc inputFileName
	     		The compiler will read in inputFileName. Intermediate codes are written to InterCode, while MIPS codes are written to MIPSCode.s.

TEST ENVIRONMENT:
	- Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
